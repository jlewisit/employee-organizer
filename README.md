# Employee Organizer

## About This Project

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. My goal for this project is to build a command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

The project is not 100% complete, but I've created a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality to this point.  Link to the video: https://watch.screencastify.com/v/Q2vzg8F98NdZENjMKvew
